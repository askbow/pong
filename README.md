# pong
All-new pong script! Moved to a separate repository from https://github.com/askbow/cloaked-octo-ironman/tree/master/pong

PONG is merely a scripted ping sequence.
It will (ICMP) ping around the world to check connectivity.

# Running
Just type ''pong'' in your command line.

# List of sites to ping
Anycast targets (IPv4 and IPv6);

Several hosts in Europe, Russia, North Amarica, Australia.

Some targets are listed as IP addresses, some as DNS.
That allows to test DNS resolution too.
(for example, sometimes there's IP connectivity but DNS is broken for some reason)
